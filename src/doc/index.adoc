= Beer Database

Based on QiWeb `{qiweb-version}`.

Inspired by the Open Beer Database, pretty different though.

HTTP JSON api written in Java.

Data is persisted thanks to JPA (Tested with H2 and PostgreSQL).

AngularJS client, built using bower and grunt.

The app is built using Gradle, including automatic grunt rebuild in dev mode.

The sample include integration tests of the HTTP api and functional tests of the AngularJS UI.

And much more.
